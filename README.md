Hello.
This is a project that using deep learning to identify traffic light signals.
It is built using fast.ai.
A resnet with 34 layers was trained with images from Bing's Image Search API.
Refer to Traffic_Light_Detector.py for the code used in the Jupyter Notebook to actually train the model. 
To actually run the Detector, refer to Traffic_Detector.ipynb. 
Run that Notebook, and make sure you have the .pkl file downloaded.
By running the second box, you may upload your own images and have them classified.
